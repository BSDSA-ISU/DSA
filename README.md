## we are  students by Sir Jonathan. ts is hard

## what we're doing on this subject?

- listening and forgeting it when we exit the classroom

### Is this subject cool?

- no

### why?

- because we barely learn java during our programming 1 and programming 2
- and also we're learning 2 programming languages already

### why they forced java in your course, Why not R, sql and Python?

- because they said Java i easier than python. .I don't think so though
